***Simple Wav Player / Editor***

This is JWav Player. It offers some run-of-the-mill basic functionality for playback and editing of wav files, but the standout feature is being able to swap beats 2 & 4 on the fly â€” which I hadn't seen elsewhere. It gives quite fun results, some songs sound aweful and some sound like a whole new version. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't turn this into an exe without a multitude of errors, even trying to run as a jar on other machines with the correct jdk didn't work, so I've given up for now.

Features:
- Load and play wav files
- View and scrub through waveform graph
- Shift pitch +- 2 octaves
- Convert stereo to mono
- Invert channels
- Pan and Gain control
- Trim start and end length
- Save changes to a new file

Fun features:
- Reverse song
- Automatically swap beats 2 & 4  
(You must know the bpm of the song, use tunebat.com)
